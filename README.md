# Sniffer

This is my first long program (at least it is long for me at this point in time). This program uses the source code of my previous project called the ARP Spoofer. This program is more upgraded and I have added all the explanations line by line as comments.

This program has the ability to ARP Spoof the target and sniffs the traffic flowing from it. It will provide informations like URLs visited, Potential Usernames and Passwords, etc. The source code of this program can be modified to make it sniff other traffic. By default I have made it to sniff HTTP Packets only. Note that this tool is currently capable of reading HTTP Packets as they are transmitted in plain text. Most websites today use HTTPS which is encrypted. This program is developed for educational purposes only. It helps in understanding how network security can be compromised and can be manipulated to get confidential credentials and information without authorization.

It is a great example of how the data that has been transmitted from the device can be compromised without even letting the user know about it. Please don't use this program on devices that you don't own. The author of this program is not responsible for any damage to devices.

This program is under development and may crash due to underlying bugs. Please let me know if you find any errors or bugs in this program. Feel free to let me know about more ideas on the further development of the project.
