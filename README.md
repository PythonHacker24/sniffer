# sniffer

This is my first long program (atleast it is long for me at this point of time). This progam uses the source code of my previous project called the ARP Spoofer. This progam is more upgraded and I have added all the explainations line by line as comments.

This program has the ability to ARP Spoof the target and sniff the traffic flowing from it. It will provide informations like URLs visited, Potential Usernames and Passwords, etc. The source code of this program can be modified to make it sniff other traffic. By default I have made it to sniff HTTP Packets only. Note that this tool is currently capable of reading HTTP Packets as they are trannsmitted in plain text. Most of the websites today use HTTPS which is encrypted. This program is developed for educational purpose only. It helps in understanding who network security can be compromised and can be manupulated to get confedential credentials and information without authorization.

It is a great example of how the data that has been transmited from the device can be compromised without even letting the user know about it. 
Please don't use this program on devices that you don't own. The author of this program is not responsible for any damage of devices.

This program is under development and may crash due to underlying bugs. Please let me know if you find any errors or bugs in this program. Feel free to let me know about more ideas on further development of the project.
